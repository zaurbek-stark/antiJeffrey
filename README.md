This is the codebase for the social media blocker extension that I built for Hamza:
<div>
<a href="https://youtu.be/6WB8uGQEADk">
<img width="316" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121587026/210021186-d559ea48-1e72-4b6c-937d-c460a8dff7bd.png">
</a>
</div>


## How to test it

1. Go to the Chrome extensions page. You can either do it by entering `chrome://extensions` in the url bar, or by opening the Chrome menu > "More tools" > "Extensions.
2. Toggle "Developper Mode" in the top right
3. Click on the "Load extension" button in the top left
4. Select the extension you want to load
5. Open youtube, instagram, or tiktok on your browser and you should see an image of Hamza popping.
